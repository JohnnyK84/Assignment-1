# GUI Best Practices

As I’ve chosen to learn to develop Electron based web apps for GUI programing this semester the following report is focused on key practices / conventions that should be considered when developing any web based application (web app). The following 8 points will be incorporated into the development of the RGB colour changer app and any future GUIs.

### Simplicity / KISS (Keep It simple stupid)
One of the essential elements an app needs to provide a great user experience is simplicity. Users should not have to spend time and  effort trying to find there way around your interface, the experience should be effortless and natural. They should be able to direct themselves around the environment of your app effortlessly and should not be confronted with confusion at any point. 
Minimising the amount of buttons and other navigational options helps avoid confusion, if your app is complex than provide a link to “advanced options”. This keeps your app simple yet offers the user advanced options if they wish to go further.

### Consistency
Having consistency throughout your app keeps it looking uniform and uncomplicated also helping to ensure simplicity in the overall functionality of the app. Colour, font, buttons and icons should all be familiar and comfortable for the user. Using funky buttons and icons can sometimes look nice but at the same time confuses the user who has to force their brain to adjust. A good example of consistency is the minimize, restore and close funtions within the Windows environment, you can almost always gurantee they will be in the top left corner of any GUI - This consistency limits the amount users have to think when navigating around your GUI environment.

### Visual Hierarchy
Important elements or features of an App that are clearly more important than others should be made to stand out. Users shouldn’t have to spend time searching the page for the main function of the app, it should stand out immediately. An example of Visual Hierarch would be create lots of white space around a call-to-action button so that it is immediately identifiable to the user.

### Segregate Design and Implementation
Program actions and logic will be separated from the HTML, CSS and design files. This type of design framework is good practice to ensure that designers without any programming experience are able to edit the interface and make design changes without help from a programmer.

### Good Use of Typography
Another graphic way to give an element within your interface some visual precedence would be through the use of good Typography. This doesn’t just mean picking a nice font and using it consistently throughout your design. Every font has its own personality and your choices should be influenced by your target audience. Size is an important component in font design. Key information such as headers are highlighted. Contrasting backgrounds are another effective way to make text stand out. The photo below shows an example of good Typography.

### Make effective use of Colour and Contrast
Picking the right colours is critical as the right choice of colours can make your interface look stunning or have the opposite effect. Poor use of colours can make your GUI look complicated or make elements hard to read, making for an unpleasant user experience. Colours can be used to convey visual hierarchy, establish a relationship between elements and also help to hold the attention of users.
Contrasting colours can be used to great effect in similar fashion to what I talked about in the Typography point before this one. Good contrasting can draw a user to a reference point on your interface, take a look at the example below:

### Simplify your forms
Forms are one of the main methods through which users will interact with your web projects. Most users don’t like filling out forms and will avoid them if possible. Therefore, it is important that a form is kept as simple as possible and integrated seamlessly into the UI. Only include fields in the form that are absolutely necessary. Users are more likely to complete a form with very few input fields than they would a complicated form with many fields to fill in. A nice example of a form is provided below from twitter:

### Know your Audience
Who better to ask to design the perfect interface for your app than the people who intend to use it. Generally, if your planning to make an app, you will already have an idea of what your target audience might want.  
You need to have a clear picture of what sort of audience you will target as you can cater your design to certain demographics if needed. The more the developer knows about the target audience, the more specific the design of the interface can be suited to that audience. For example the font and colour scheme used to target a young audience would more than likely be quite different to the font and colour scheme used to target an older audience.

### The imoprtance of a GOOD GUI
The importance of a user friendly interface for any environment is vital. A good user interface can attract high volumes of internet traffic. In todays era there is huge growth in e-commerce, their is a huge amount of businesses that are completely dependent on the internet for there success. If you have a UI that is not functional, hard to use, too complex or messy, than chances are not many people will visit your website or use your app so this really highlights the importance of a good user friendly GUI.
