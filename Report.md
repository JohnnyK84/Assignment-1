# GUI Best Practices

As I’ve chosen to learn to develop Electron based web apps for GUI programing this semester the following report is focused on key practices/conventions that should be considered when developing any web based application (web app). The following 8 points will be incorporated into the development of the RGB colour changer app.

### Simplicity / KISS (Keep I simple stupid)
One of the essential elements an app needs to provide a great user experience is simplicity. Users should not have to spend time and  effort figuring out how to navigate around and use your app. They should be able to direct themselves around the environment of your  app effortlessly and should not be confronted with confusion at any point. 
Minimising the amount of buttons and other navigational options helps avoid confusion, if your app is complex than provide a link to “advanced options”. This keeps your app simple yet offers the user advanced options if they wish to go further.

### Consistency
Having consistency throughout your app keeps it looking uniform and uncomplicated also helping to ensure simplicity in the overall appearance of the app. Colour, font, buttons and icons should all be familiar and comfortable for the user. Using funky buttons and icons can sometimes look nice but at the same time confuses the user who has to force their brain to adjust.

### Visual Hierarchy
Important elements or features of an App that are clearly more important than others should be made to stand out. Users shouldn’t have to spend time searching the page for the main function of the app, it should stand out immediately. An example of Visual Hierarch would be create lots of white space around a call-to-action button so that it is immediately identifiable to the user.

### Segregate Design and Implementation
Program actions and logic will be separated from the HTML, CSS and design files. This type of design framework is good practice to ensure that designers without any programming experience are able to edit the interface and make design changes without help from a programmer.

### Good Use of Typography
Another graphic way to give an element within your interface some visual precedence would be through the use of good Typography. This doesn’t just mean picking a nice font and using it consistently throughout your design. Every font has its own personality and your choices should be influenced by your target audience. Size is an important component in font design. Key information such as headers are highlighted. Contrasting backgrounds are another effective way to text stand out. I’ve attached the photo below from https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/10-rules-of-good-ui-design-to-follow-on-every-web-design-project which showcases this:

### Make effective use of Colour and Contrast
Picking the right colours is critical as the right choice of colours can make your interface look stunning or have the opposite effect. Poor use of colours can make your GUI look complicated or make elements hard to read, making for an unpleasant user experience. Colours can be used to convey visual hierarchy, establish a relationship between elements and also help to hold the attention of users.
Contrasting colours can be used to great effect in similar fashion to what I talked about in the Typography point before this one. Good contrasting can draw a user to a reference point on your interface, take a look at the example below:

### Simplify your forms
Forms are one of the main methods through which users will interact with your web projects. Most users don’t like filling out forms and will avoid them if possible. Therefore, it is important that a form is kept as simple as possible and integrated seamlessly into the UI. Only include fields in the form that are absolutely necessary. Users are more likely to complete a form with very few input fields than they would a complicated form with many fields to fill in. A nice example of a form is provided below from twitter:

### Know your Audience
Who better to ask to design the perfect interface for your app than the people who intend to use it. Generally, if your planning to make an app, you will already have an idea of what your target audience might want.  
You need to have a clear picture of what sort of audience you will target as you can cater your design to certain demographics if needed. For example you would be likely to use a totally different style font / colour scheme if your App was focused towards younger generation as opposed to an older generation. The more the UI developer knows about the target audience, the more specific the design of the interface can be suited to that audience.
